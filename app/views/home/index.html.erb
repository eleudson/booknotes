<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>
This program is designed for you to organize notes for your books or other publications, so it helps to organize research and bibliography.
</p><br />
<p>
I also use this one to learn Ruby on Rails and seek the maximum use of standard programming framework.
</p><br />
<p>
If you use it and not "login", send me an email (eleudson at lab.inf.uc3m.es) with your information that you send the data to access. This is because this is a software still in development and, therefore, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF USE OR MAINTENANCE OF STORED DATA.
</p><br />
<p>
Soon the source files are in GitHub site for others to use this program and change the measure of their needs.
</p><br />
<p>
Thank you for your interest,
</p><br />
<p>
